#### **Title:**
Flight in Flux: Analyzing American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus) Migration Timing and Climate Change

**Introduction:**
	Climate change poses many questions relating to systems across the globe, especially ecological and evolutionary systems. One system which could potentially be heavily impacted is migration. Bird migration timing is critical for ensuring species survival and ecological balance. As anthropogenic climate change has altered seasonal patterns, there is a potential disruption to migration timing, impacting birds' breeding success, food availability, and overall population health.  The American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), for example, depends on the thriving vegetation of marshlands for camouflage and nesting, as they are known to nest on the ground. Wetland birds are expected to be affected negatively by a considerable margin with the presence of a changing climate altering their regular migratory ranges and patterns (Steen et al., 2012).

**Abstract/Background:**
The American Bittern is a solitary, cryptic species that relies on wetlands for breeding and overwintering. Typically, these birds breed in freshwater marshes across Canada and the northern United States before migrating south to the southeastern U.S., Mexico, and Central America for the winter. However, increasing global temperatures, shifts in precipitation, and habitat loss due to climate change threaten to disrupt these migration patterns.	
Past studies on migratory birds indicate that climate change is leading to earlier spring arrivals, delayed fall departures, and shifts in overall migration routes (La Sorte & Thompson, 2007). For wetland-dependent birds like the American Bittern, changes in water levels due to altered precipitation cycles could further complicate their ability to find suitable stopover sites and breeding grounds. Given that wetlands are already among the most threatened ecosystems in North America, with significant losses due to urbanization and agriculture, climate-induced changes pose an additional challenge (Dahl, 2011).
Studying the migration patterns of the American Bittern under a changing climate is essential for predicting future population trends and informing conservation strategies. By understanding how climate variables influence their movements, conservationists can prioritize habitat protection, restoration, and adaptive management to mitigate potential negative impacts.


**Motivation:**
Bird migration range and timing is critical for ensuring species survival and ecological balance. However, climate change has altered seasonal patterns, potentially disrupting migration timing and impacting breeding success, food availability, and overall population health. Understanding these shifts can inform conservation strategies and mitigate risks to migratory bird species. Additionally, information gained from analyzing one species can be used to make inferences about the potential shifts in other similar species.
