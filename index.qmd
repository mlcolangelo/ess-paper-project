#### **Project Proposal #1 (Neva):**

Title: Bark Beetle effects on Forest Carbon Sequestration as it relates to Tree Mortality and Infection Rates.


**Justification:**


This study project will help bridge the gap between understanding how bark beetle infestations will play in overall carbon sequestration that occurs from forestsed ecosystems in Colorado. Bark beetle, a native species, has become a contentious topic regarding forestry and fire management regemes (Coon). As percribed forest burns were a controversial method for thinning forests, created forests that now contain more thin trunked trees that are overall weaker in their ability to fight off bark beetle infections (Negrón et al). The inscet has taken advantage of the close proximity of the trees, as well as the limited sap content that would have normally prevented disease and overal destruction of the tree. Over time, with more dried and dead trees appearing in forests, and with the increasing pressure of climate variability has been promoted by climate change, we experience forest fires that burn, longer, larger, and more destructive than what would have been occurring naturally (Negrón et al). This study can understand how the carbon sequestration of old growth forests has changed due to the increased pressures that bark beetle possess.

**Research objective/question/hypothesis:**


Objective: Understand the dynamics that trees killed by bark beetle has on carbon sequestration in forests in Colorado from 1997 to 2010.


Question: How does carbon sequestration of Colorado forests as measured by carbon flux, storage, and carbon stocks change due to incfreased pressures of bark beetle infection, disease, and death?


Hypothesis: Carbon sequestration of Colorado forests infected by bark beetle will be lower than those not killed by bark beetle.

Null: Bark beetle tree mortability has no effect on carbon sequestion rates in Colorado.


**Proposed Methods:**


The dataset that we have provided, can range dramtically in the scale of where we are wanting to look at. I currently (and thanks to Mike Johnson), have found a data set authored by A.J.J. Meddens et al., that covers tree mortality, area of mortality, and the percentage of the total killed trees by bark beetle species. This data was collected for the entrie U.S. from 1997 to 2010, so we will need to specify Colorado specifically, but we are also still deciding if there is a specific location within Colorado forests tat we would want to test for. This data is crucial for understanding how death specifically by bark beetles is covered within our area of interest.


The second dataset that we will be testing is from Colorado Information Marketplace, and focuses of the Forest carbon net sequestations in Colorado from 1990 to 2010. This data was created (and updated) in 2014 and focuses on carbon flux, storage, emissions, and carbon stocks (soil organic carbon), as we examine how bark beetle tree mortality percentage is potentially interacting with this will be interesting to find out later!


We would be using a correlation t-test that can help us undertsand the statistical significance of whether both of these variable are correlated or not.

**Expected Outcomes:**

Based on your research question, describe what you expect to find in the results and the reason such an outcome is important. (5 points)


We can expect to find that as carbon sequestration decreases, we probability of an increase bark beetle tree mortality rate. We can assume tnhis because if more trees are killed from bark beetle infestations, it increases a likelihood that non-perscribed forest fires will occur, in return off setting the old growth carbon stocks that are correlated to these areas. It's important for us to understand why bark beetles are in these areas that are dense with smaller weaker trees, so forest thinning process management styles can be a more frequented regulation style.

**Title:**

Diesel Exhaust Air Pollutant Concentrations effect of Lung Cancer Risk in Taos, New Mexico.


**Justification:**


As diesel burns from vehicle engine combustion, materials containing organic and inorganic particulates escape into air. Many ofthese particles contain mutagens, carcinogens, and other toxic substances (Kagawa et al). With an increasing need for vehicles to run on more carbon efficient and air pollutant reductant fuels, diesel, remains to be a large issue as it is related to lung cancer risks (Kagawa et al). With an increased exposure to such toxic fumes increases an individuals to airway inflammatory diseases, leadning people to potentially contract asthma, chronic bronchitis, and lung cancer (Pandya et al). The need for undertsnaing these risks is crucial in defining how states and counties regulate their effects on their citizens. The data provided focuses on the population in the county of Taos in New Mexico, as observed from 2016 to 2023. We will measure the mean concentration of the diesel PM air pollutant and the lifetime lung cancer risk within the Taos County, from data developed by the EPA.

**Research objective/question/hypothesis:**


Objective: Understand the lifetime risk of lung cancer as it is effected by the concentration of diesel air pollutants within the Taos County of New Mexico from 2016 to 2023.


Questions: How does the presences of the concentration of diesel PM air pollutants effects the likelihood of lung cancer risk over a person's lifetime within Taos County from 2016 to 2023?


Hypothesis: A higher mean concentration of diesel particulate air pollution will increase a person's risk of developing lung cancer in their lifetime within Taos County, NM.

Null: The concentration of diesel air pollution does not have any effect on a person's lifetime risk of developing lung cancer.



**Proposed Methods:**


The data sets for this research are both collected by the EPA as sourced from Data Commons, the first undertsancding the mean concentration of diesel PM air pollutants within Taos County. With 10 variables, three of wnhich are focused for this study: pollutant (DieselParticulateMatter - diesel PM), measureProperty (concentration of the diesel PM), and the memberOF (annual mean concentration of the diesel PM). This data was measured over the course of 8 years from 2016 to 2023, ranging over the general area of Taos County within New Mexico.


The second data set, which also was sourced by the EPA from Data Commons focuses on the Cancer Risk in general by air pollutants within Taos County. Measuring again 10 variables, we are focused on looking at constraintProperties (pollutant health risk), measuredProperty (lifetime contraction probability), and pollutantHealthRisk (cancer). This data was also collected ove 8 years from 2016 to 2023 within the Taos County, and will

match the previous data source as they are overlapped in their spatial and temporal periods.


We can utlizize many linear regression models and testing whether there is a correlation between the variable, most likely to use a t-test, which tests the correlation between variables as a reliable source for understanding this kind of dynamic.

**Expected Outcomes:**


Based on previous academic knowledge and resources we have found, we can expect there to be a correlation between the concentration of diesel air pollutants and the lifettime risks of developing cancer. Judging the data already, there is a visual correlation between the two, that can be further discovered within our report. It will also be important to understand how other pollutants or other factors concerning cancer risk have changed within that time period within the Taos County to make sure we aren't simply finding a mis-correlation.



#### **Project Proposal #3 (Mia):**
Title: Analyzing Canada Goose Migration Timing and Climate Change

**Justification:**
Bird migration timing is critical for ensuring species survival and ecological balance. However, climate change has altered seasonal patterns, potentially disrupting migration timing and impacting breeding success, food availability, and overall population health. Understanding these shifts can inform conservation strategies and mitigate risks to migratory bird species.

**Research objective/question/hypothesis:**
Objective: To investigate the relationship between annual temperature changes and seasonal patterns due to climate change and their impact on the timing of bird migration over the past two decades.
Question: How has bird migration timing shifted in response to changes in annual temperature and seasonal patterns caused by climate change?
Hypothesis: Climate change, as indicated by rising annual temperatures and altered seasonal patterns, is significantly correlated with earlier bird migration timing over the past two decades. (Null: Climate change has had no effect on the migration timing of birds.)

**Proposed Methods:**
Obtain bird migration timing and historical climate data (temperature, precipitation, etc.). Process datasets to handle any missing values or inconsistencies. Use correlation tests and regression modeling to determine relationships between climate variables and migration timing. Create plots (e.g., line charts, scatter plots) to illustrate changes in migration timing over time and their connection to temperature trends.

**Expected Outcomes:**
We expect to identify trends in bird migration timing (e.g., earlier or delayed migrations) and obtain statistical evidence of correlations between climate variables (e.g., temperature) and migration timing. From these results, we can gain insights into the broader ecological impacts of altered migration patterns, such as food availability and breeding success.

**Title:**
Effects of Urbanization on Pollinator Populations

**Justification:**
Pollinators play a key role in ecosystems and agriculture by facilitating plant reproduction. Urbanization often reduces green spaces and increases impervious surfaces, which may negatively impact pollinator abundance and diversity. Research on this relationship can help guide urban planning to support pollinator-friendly environments.

“U.S. Geological Survey.” ScienceBase, 15 May 2019, www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d4c6b79e4b01d82ce8dfd48. 

**Research objective/question/hypothesis:**
Objective: Investigate whether urbanization negatively impacts the abundance or diversity of pollinators like bees or butterflies.

Questions: What is the relationship between urbanization levels and the abundance and diversity of pollinator species in urban areas?

Hypothesis: Higher levels of urbanization, characterized by reduced green space and increased impervious surface area, lead to a significant decline in pollinator abundance and species diversity.


**Proposed Methods:**
Source urbanization metrics from regional or local conservation studies. Standardize datasets for consistent analysis. Perform hypothesis tests and regression modeling to investigate relationships between urbanization and pollinator variables. Use maps and bar charts to showcase pollinator patterns across urban, suburban, and rural areas.


**Expected Outcomes:**
From this project, we can expect identification of trends showing reduced pollinator abundance and diversity in highly urbanized areas, as well as quantitative insights into the relationship between green space proportions and pollinator populations. Based on this data, we can make practical recommendations for urban planning that prioritizes pollinator-friendly environments.
